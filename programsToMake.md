## Useful Programs to make:
* Convert a PDF table to a word document or text file
* VDJ aligner (need to research more into what should be used)
* make a program that will convert sequences to an established OTU table 
	* based on consensus sequence and 90% similarity
	* creates a OTU table with this information
		* figure out how to deal with gaps (count as 1, count each one, ignore, or base on similarity)
		* figure out what to do with new sequences that don't match any OTUs
		* typical closed-reference approaches use 97% similarity
* Make a program that will blast 16S rRNA sequences and return any that have a 100% coverage and > 97% identity
